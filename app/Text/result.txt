The most commonly-used values of mode are |*r*/ for reading, "w*) for writing (truncating
the file if it already exists), and |"a") for appending (which on some Unix systems means
that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). If mode
is omitted, it defaults to |*F*). The default is to use text mode, which may convert "Xn"
characters to a platform-specific representation on writing and back on reading. Thus,
when opening a binary file, you should append |*B*) to the mode value to open the file in
binary mode, which will improve portability. (Appending |"b*) is useful even on systems
that donâ€™t treat binary and text files differently, where it serves as documentation.) See
below for more possible values of mode.
